SQL
SQL stands for structured query language ,which is used to retrieve ,manipulate and accessing the data
SQL is a software used to access the Relational DBMS
In RDBMS the data is stored in the form of tables which contains rows and columns
SQL is of two types such as 
•	DDL
•	DML
DDL- data definition language
This is the language which helps in creating and altering the database and does some functions such as
•	CREATE-The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a database
SQL CREATE TABLE Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column_name1 datatype,
column_name2 datatype
....
)

•	DROP-The DROP DATABASE statement is used to delete the database table
SQL DROP TABLE Syntax

DROP TABLE table_name;

•	ALTER- The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
SQL ALTER TABLE Syntax

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

•	TRUNCATE-The TRUNCATE DATABASE statement is used to delete the data inside the table
SQL TRUNCATE TABLE Syntax

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
DML-data manipulation language
	This helps in manipulating the data in the database and does the functions such as
•	SELECT
Syntax-
	SELECT * FROM table_name;
•	INSERT
Syntax-
	INSERT INTO table_name
	VALUES (value1,value2,………);
•	DELETE
Syntax-
	DELETE FROM table_name 
	WHERE condition;
•	UPDATE
Syntax-
	UPDATE table_name
	SET column1=value1,column2=value2,……
	WHERE condition;
Keys-An SQL key is either a single column or a group of columns that can be uniquely identify rows in a table. It also helps in establishing the relationship between multiple tables in the database.
Types of keys in sql-
•	Primary key
•	Unique key
•	Foreign key
•	Candidate key
•	Super key
•	Alternate key
•	Composite key
Unique key- It is a set of one or more than one fields of a table that uniquely identify the row in a database table
Implementation-
CREATE TABLE student
(
sl_no int,
student_id int,
student_name varchar(255)
)
Primary key-It is a unique key which does not contains any NULL values.
Implementation-
CREATE TABLE student
(
sl_no int,
student_id int,
PRIMARY KEY (sl_no)
)
Foreign key- It is a column that creates a relationship between two tables .The purpose of foreign key is to maintain the data integrity 
Implementation-

CREATE TABLE student
(
sl_no int,
student_id int,
PRIMARY KEY (sl_no),
FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES department(dep_id)
)



CREATE TABLE department
(
dep_id int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
City varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (sl_no)
)

Candidate key -It is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table ,it is a super key with no repeated attributes
Super key- It is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.
Composite key- It is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify the rows in a table.
 Alternate key-It is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
SQL CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

SQL DEFAULT Constraint
The DEFAULT constraint is used to insert a default value into a column.

AND operator - if both the first condition and the second condition are true.
OR operator - if either the first condition or the second condition is true.

SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE FirstName=’peter’
AND LastName LIKE ‘%s’

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default.

The GROUP BY Statement
The GROUP BY statement is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of some functions
The HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions
Syntax-
	SELECT column1,column2
	FROM table GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition;
SQL JOIN
SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables
Types of JOINS:
•	INNER JOIN  -  The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition satisfies
•	LEFT JOIN – This joins returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows for the table on the right side of join
•	RIGHT JOIN- This joins returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of join
•	FULL JOIN-It creates the result-set by combining result of both left join and right join .The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables.

UNION- The UNION operator is used to combine the result set of two or more SELECT statements
Implementation-
SELECT student_id FROM student
UNION
SELECT dep_id FROM department;
SQL VIEW Statement
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.
