INTRODUCTION TO JAVA
History:
It was developed by Sun Microsystems by James Gosling in 1995,The very first name of java is “Oak”.
Features of java:
•	It’s an object oriented language- which deals with only objects.
•	Java is a platform Independent -when the java code is compiled once ,then it can be executed on any platform.
•	Java is simple and easy to learn
•	Java provides security has it as class loaders and byte code verifiers
•	It provides multi-threading property -many tasks are done at a same time.
•	It’s a dynamic language-carry run-time information that are used to verify and resolve the errors.
•	It is distributed language.
•	It’s a robust-it mainly focuses on compile time errors checking and runtime checking.
•	It’s a portable language
•	It provides good performance
OOPS IN JAVA:
OOPS is basically as name suggest, it totally deals with objects and the main aim of the oops is data hiding, reusability and security.
There are some concepts in OOPS:
•	Objects
•	Class
•	Inheritance
•	Abstraction
•	Encapsulation
•	Polymorphism
Object- It’s a real world entity and it has both state and behavior  and It’s an Instance of class
Class- It’s a blueprint of objects and it contains data members and  member functions 
Implementation:
class calculator:
	def addition(self ,a ,b):
		return a+ b
	def sub(self ,a ,b): 
		return a-b
obj=calculator()
print(obj. addition(2,5))


Inheritance- Acquiring the properties of parent class to the child class is called inheritance
	Basically ,in JAVA there are different types of Inheritance
•	Single Inheritance
•	Multi-level Inheritance
•	Hierarchy Inheritance
Implementation
class father:
	def addition(self ,a ,b):
		return a+ b
	def sub(self ,a ,b): 
		return a-b
class mother:
	def addition(self ,a ,b):
		return a+b-1
	def multiplication(self ,a ,b):
		return a*b
class son(father ,mother):
	def addition(self ,a ,b):
		return a+b+2
	def division(self ,a, b):
		return a//b
 obj=son()
print(obj. addition(2,5))

Abstraction-Showing off the important data and hiding the unnecessary data and implementation is called Abstraction.
Encapsulation- Wrapping up of data into a single unit is called Encapsulation.
Polymorphism – When a single task is performed in different ways then it is said to be Polymorphism.
There are two types of polymorphism-
•	Run-time -Method overriding
•	Compile-time-Method overloading
Method Overloading- when a single class has different methods of same method name and with different arguments and arguments size 
Method Overriding- It provides the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by superclass.
Data types-
•	Integral-All the integers comes under this type
•	Non-integral-floating-Except integers all the decimal values 
•	Characters- The letters and characters comes under this type
•	Boolean- this datatype has two literals -True and False

OOAD
It’s a Object Oriented Analysis and Design
The main  purpose of OOAD is to identify the objects and relationships between them and design and implement accordingly.
It analyzes and design the applications and used in visual-modelling throughout the development
The process will be in this order-
•	OO Analysis
•	OO Design
•	OO Implementation
The design is implemented after analysis and design, using Object Oriented programming languages such as Java ,C++, etc …
UML
It stands for Unified Modelling Language
It’s a graphical language used in software developments, it deal with some notations to produce the models.
The main purpose of the UML is to visualize the Architectural-blueprint
The UML originally designed by the three amigos at rational crop-they are:
•	Booch -Excellent for design and implementation
•	Jim- Best for analysis
•	Ivar-Understanding the behavior of entire system.
