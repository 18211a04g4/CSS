NORMALIZATION
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates     undesirable characteristics such as anomalies
Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables
•	First Normal Form  
Rules –
Each table cell should contain a single value.
Each record needs to be unique.
•	Second Normal Form
Rules-
Be in 1NF
Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation

•	Third Normal Form
Rules-
Be in 2NF
Has no transitive functional dependencies

•	Boyce-Codd Normal Form
Rules-
Even when a database is in 3rd Normal Form, still there would be anomalies resulted if it has more than one Candidate Key.
Sometimes is BCNF is also referred as 3.5 Normal Form.

•	Fourth Normal Form
Rules-
	If no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing the relevant entity, then it is in 4th Normal Form.
•	Fifth Normal Form
Rules-
A table is in 5th Normal Form only if it is in 4NF and it cannot be decomposed into any number of smaller tables without loss of data
•	Sixth Normal Form
Rules-
Sixth Normal Form is not standardized, yet however, it is being discussed by database experts for some time.
Anomalies –
•	Insertion– This occurs when an attempt to insert data into a non-existent record.
•	Deletion– Incomplete deletion of a particular data section which leaves some residual instances. The database creator remains unaware of such unwanted data as it is present at a different location.
•	Update– When several instances of the same data are scattered across the database without proper relationship/link, it could cause strange conditions where a few of the instances will get updated with new values whereas some of them will not. This leaves the database in an inconsistent state.
DATABASE
A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed
Modes of storing data-
•	Relational data model-The data which is stored in the form of tables, contains rows and columns
•	Hierarchical data model-The data which is stored in the form of trees, which contains nodes
•	Network data model- The data which is stored in the form of graphs , Its a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges
Normalization- It is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 
Advantages of normalization:
It helps in reducing or removing the anomalies and provides data integrity
Anomalies are –
•	Insertion 
•	Deletion
•	Update
Functional Dependency
The functional dependency is a relationship that exists between two attributes. It typically exists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table.
Partial Dependency
Partial Dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on part of a candidate key.
•	The 2nd Normal Form (2NF) eliminates the Partial Dependency.
There are some normal forms which helps us to reduces the anomalies and redundancy of data and provides the data integrity effectively.
